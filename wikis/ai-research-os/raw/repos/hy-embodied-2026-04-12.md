## ? Updates

  * **`[2026-04-09]`** ? We have released **HY-Embodied-0.5**, featuring the open-sourced `HY-Embodied-0.5 MoT-2B` weights on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/tencent/HY-Embodied-0.5/tree/main) along with the official inference code\!

## ? Abstract

We introduce **HY-Embodied-0.5**, a suite of foundation models tailored specifically for real-world embodied intelligence. To bridge the gap between general Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and the strict demands of physical agents, our models are engineered to excel in spatial-temporal visual perception and complex embodied reasoning (prediction, interaction, and planning).

The suite features an innovative **Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT)** architecture utilizing latent tokens for modality-specific computing, significantly enhancing fine-grained perception. It includes two primary variants: a highly efficient **2B model** for edge deployment and a powerful **32B model** for complex reasoning. Through a self-evolving post-training paradigm and large-to-small on-policy distillation, our compact MoT-2B outperforms state-of-the-art models of similar size across 16 benchmarks, while the 32B variant achieves frontier-level performance comparable to Gemini 3.0 Pro. Ultimately, HY-Embodied serves as a robust "brain" for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) pipelines, delivering compelling results in real-world physical robot control.

## ?? Key Features

  * ? **Evolved MoT Architecture:** Designed for maximum efficiency without sacrificing visual acuity. The MoT-2B variant contains 4B total parameters but requires **only 2.2B activated parameters** during inference. By emphasizing modality-specific computing in the vision pathway, it achieves the high inference speed of a dense 2B model while delivering superior, fine-grained perceptual representations.
  * ? **High-Quality Mixed Chain Reasoning:** We introduce an advanced iterative, self-evolving post-training pipeline. By employing on-policy distillation, we successfully transfer the sophisticated step-by-step reasoning, planning, and high-quality "thinking" capabilities from our powerful 32B model directly to the compact 2B variant.
  * ? **Large-Scale Embodied Pre-training:** Grounded in a massive, specially curated dataset comprising **\>100 million** embodied and spatial-specific data points. Trained on a corpus exceeding **200 billion tokens**, the model develops a deep, native understanding of 3D spaces, physical object interactions, and agent dynamics.
  * ? **Stronger VLA Application:** Beyond standard academic benchmarks, HY-Embodied is engineered to be the core cognitive engine for physical robots. It seamlessly integrates into Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks, acting as a highly robust and capable brain to drive high success rates in complex, real-world robotic control tasks.

from transformers import AutoModelForImageTextToText, AutoProcessor

# Load model & processor
MODEL_PATH = "tencent/HY-Embodied-0.5"
DEVICE = "cuda"
THINKING_MODE = False
TEMPERATURE = 0.8

processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(MODEL_PATH)

# Load chat template if available
chat_template_path = os.path.join(MODEL_PATH, "chat_template.jinja")
if os.path.exists(chat_template_path):
    processor.chat_template = open(chat_template_path).read()

model = AutoModelForImageTextToText.from_pretrained(MODEL_PATH, torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)
model.to(DEVICE).eval()

# Prepare input messages
messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "image", "image": "./figures/example.jpg"},
            {"type": "text", "text": "Describe the image in detail."},
        ],
    }
]

# Process and generate
inputs = processor.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    tokenize=True,
    add_generation_prompt=True,
    return_dict=True,
    return_tensors="pt",
    enable_thinking=THINKING_MODE,
).to(model.device)

with torch.no_grad():
    generated_ids = model.generate(
        **inputs,
        max_new_tokens=32768,
        use_cache=True,
        temperature=TEMPERATURE,
        do_sample=TEMPERATURE > 0,
    )

output_ids = [out[len(inp):] for inp, out in zip(inputs.input_ids, generated_ids)]
print(processor.batch_decode(output_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0])
```

    processor.chat_template = open(chat_template_path).read()

model = AutoModelForImageTextToText.from_pretrained(MODEL_PATH, torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)
model.to(DEVICE).eval()

# Batch Inference (multiple prompts at once)
messages_batch = [
    # Sample A: image + text
    [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {"type": "image", "image": "./figures/example.jpg"},
                {"type": "text", "text": "Describe the image in detail."},
            ],
        }
    ],
    # Sample B: text only

            "content": [
                {"type": "text", "text": "How to open a fridge?"},
            ],
        }

for i, msgs in enumerate(messages_batch):
    out_ids = batch_generated_ids[i][padded_input_len:]
