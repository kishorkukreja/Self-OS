# Part 1: What I'm Already Doing Well

These are patterns from a live setup that are genuinely worth replicating. Each one represents real operational leverage.

## 1. The "Two OS" Architecture

I run two separate repos, each with their own `CLAUDE.md`:
- **WorkOS** — work skills (meeting prep, memos, RFDs, PM methodology, voice ghostwriting, ICP evaluation, rhetorical analysis)
- **PersonalOS** — personal skills and compute (health data, iMessage relationship analysis, MCP servers)

**Why it matters:** Clean separation of concerns. Work context never bleeds into personal tools and vice versa. Each CLAUDE.md stays focused and under the ~300-line sweet spot.

**Pattern to copy:** If you have distinct domains (work vs. personal, or multiple projects), give each its own repo with its own CLAUDE.md rather than cramming everything into one.

## 2. Trigger-Phrase Architecture

Instead of slash commands or memorizing syntax, I use natural language triggers:

| I say... | Claude loads... |
|----------|----------------|
| "prep [name]" | meeting-prep skill ? full meeting pre-brief |
| "draft a post" | ghostwriter skill ? ghostwritten content |
| "PM a [concept]" | product-mgmt skill ? 9-step Working Backwards process |
| "grade this" | content-review skill ? rhetorical analysis |
| "health sleep" | health-tracker skill ? sleep analysis |

**Why it matters:** Zero friction. I don't think about *tools* — I think about *outcomes*. Claude matches my intent to the right skill using LLM reasoning, not regex.

**Pattern to copy:** Write your skill descriptions as natural phrases people would actually say. "Create a deployment plan for staging or production" beats "Deploy stuff."

## 3. Skills as Markdown Files with Reference Data

Each skill is a directory:
```
skills/meeting-prep/
??? meeting-prep.md    ? the skill (triggers, workflows, guardrails)
??? ref-tools.md       ? reference material (API docs, tool catalog)
```

**Why it matters:** The skill file tells Claude *what to do*. The ref file gives it *what it needs to know*. Progressive disclosure — Claude loads ref data only when the skill is triggered, not on every conversation.

**Pattern to copy:** Don't paste your entire API reference into CLAUDE.md. Put it in a ref file and tell Claude where to find it.

## 4. MCP-First Data Gathering

My skills are designed to pull live data from every available source *before* producing output. The meeting-prep skill, for example:
- Pulls calendar events (Google Calendar MCP)
- Searches email threads (Gmail MCP)
- Researches attendees (Playwright MCP ? LinkedIn)
- Pulls meeting transcripts (Granola MCP)
- Searches Notion for relevant docs
- Does web research on companies

**Why it matters:** The briefing is always richer than what I could assemble manually. Claude does in 30 seconds what would take me 15-20 minutes.

**Pattern to copy:** When building skills, list every data source Claude should pull from. Be explicit: "Search Gmail for threads with [attendee]. Search Notion for relevant docs. Web search [company] for recent news."

## 5. Global MCP Configuration

All 7+ MCP servers are configured globally in `~/.claude.json`, not per-project. They're available everywhere:

| Server | What It Does |
|--------|-------------|
| Google Drive | Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Calendar |
| Gmail | Read/send email |
| Jira | Issues, projects, boards, sprints |
| Slack | Channels, messages, conversations |
| iMessage | 25 read-only tools for message history |
| Playwright | Browser automation (LinkedIn, web research) |
| Granola | Meeting transcripts |
| Notion | Search, fetch, create/update (built-in connector) |

**Why it matters:** No configuration drift. Every session has the same capabilities. I never think "do I have access to X?" — the answer is always yes.

**Pattern to copy:** Use `claude mcp add` to configure servers globally. Reserve per-project MCP for project-specific servers only.

## 6. Confirmation Gates on Destructive Actions

My skills explicitly do NOT send emails, push Slack messages, or make calendar changes without confirmation. Claude drafts, I confirm.

**Why it matters:** I can let Claude operate with broad access (push to git, read all my email, access Slack) because the guardrails are in the *skills*, not the *permissions*. Trust but verify at the action boundary.

**Pattern to copy:** In your skill files, add explicit rules like: "Draft the Slack message and present it for approval. Do NOT send until the user confirms."

## 7. Pre-Approved Permissions for Speed

My `settings.local.json` pre-approves dozens of commands:
- Safe git operations (log, status, diff, push to specific repos)
- npm/node commands for MCP servers
- Specific MCP tools (Jira search, iMessage read, Notion fetch)
- WebFetch for specific domains

**Why it matters:** Eliminates the "approve/deny" friction that makes Claude feel slow. Safe commands fly through instantly. Risky commands still prompt me.

**Pattern to copy:** Start with a small allowlist and expand it over time. Pre-approve `git log`, `git status`, `git diff`, and your test runner first.

## 8. Structured Output to Defined Locations

- Analyses ? `analyses/<firstname-lastname>.md`
- PM packages ? `products/`
- RFDs ? Notion database
- Meeting debriefs ? Slack (after confirmation)

**Why it matters:** I always know where to find things. No ad hoc files scattered everywhere.

**Pattern to copy:** Define output locations in your skill files. "Save the analysis to `analyses/<name>.md`" ensures consistency.

## 9. Environment-Aware Skills

Every skill documents what's available in Claude Code vs. Claude AI:
```
Claude Code: Google Drive MCP, Gmail MCP, Jira MCP, Slack MCP, Playwright...
Claude AI: Google Calendar (built-in), Email (built-in), Web search...
```

**Why it matters:** The same skills work in both environments. Claude gracefully degrades when a tool isn't available, following inline fallbacks.

**Pattern to copy:** If your skills need to work across environments, document what's available where and add fallback instructions.

## 10. User Identity System

WorkOS detects who's using it (via `git config user.name`) and adapts:
- If the owner ? use the ghostwriter voice for memos and posts
- If a team member ? use professional prose, but can still invoke the ghostwriter to write *for* the owner

**Why it matters:** One skill set serves the entire team. No per-user configuration needed.

**Pattern to copy:** If multiple people share your CLAUDE.md, add identity detection. "Check `git config user.name` to determine the current user."

## 11. Hook-Driven Self-Maintenance

The most durable environments don't need manual upkeep — the hooks keep them in sync. Three hooks run silently on every file edit:

- **`claude-context-updater.sh`** — when a skill, hook script, or MCP source file is modified, appends a timestamped note to `MEMORY.md` so the next session knows what changed
- **`test-suite-updater.sh`** — when a new skill or MCP source file is created, automatically inserts the corresponding `assert_file_exists` assertion into `run-tests.sh`, keeping test coverage current without manual edits
- **`remote-approver.sh`** — on any `PermissionRequest`, sends a push notification to phone via ntfy.sh with Approve/Deny action buttons; falls back to local prompt after 90 seconds

The result: add a new skill file ? tests automatically cover it. Edit a hook ? MEMORY.md logs it. Start a long autonomous task ? approve permissions from your phone.

**Why it matters:** Maintenance work that requires developer attention compounds over time. Hooks that maintain the environment autonomously pay back immediately and permanently.

**Pattern to copy:** Think about what goes stale in your setup (tests, docs, logs) and write PostToolUse hooks that update them. Start with file existence tests — they're simple to auto-generate and prevent silent gaps.
